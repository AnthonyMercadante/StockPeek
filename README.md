Selenium is a Python library and tool used for automating web brwosers to do a number of tasks. One of such tasks is web-scraping to extract useful data and information that may be otherwise unavailable.

WebDriver is a vital ingredient to this process. It is what will actually be automatically opening up your browser to access your website of choice.

I happen to use Google Chrome. Some say Chrome works best with Selenium, although it does also support Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.
